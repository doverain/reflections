What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create an area where git can work and track changes.  To isolate your 
files from others.  To better manage effects of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository?
It's a temporary area.
What value do you think it offers?  Isolates changes

The following will compare changes in files in the working area
git diff

run the following before doing a commit to do double check:
git diff --staged

The following command will discard and changes to files in the working 
directory and staging area.  Be careful, You can't get changes back.
git reset --hard

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?  Do a get diff and check what changes you are committing.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized?  How would branches help?
If you want to work on a new part of a program, but let the original keep going,
maybe being updated by someone else.  It would keep the new part isolated,
so it wouldn't step on anything.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
You can see the linkages easily.
